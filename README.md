# Real-Analysis

Codes and graphs of certain interesting functions and numerical analysis techniques present in the book "Introduction to Real Analysis" by "Bartle & Sherbert"(4th Edition).

The main aim of this repo is to have fun with an otherwise pure mathematical course.
The programming languages used will be mainly R and C.
Another motive of this repo is to practise plotting in R, using ggplot2, which I've recently learnt.
